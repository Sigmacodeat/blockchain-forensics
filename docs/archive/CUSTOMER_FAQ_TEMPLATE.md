## üõ°Ô∏è WALLET GUARDIAN

### "How does it work without my private keys?"
```
Great question! We NEVER need your private keys.

How it works:
1. You provide your wallet ADDRESS (public)
2. We scan transactions BEFORE you sign them
3. Protection works at the network level
4. Your keys stay in YOUR wallet (MetaMask/etc.)

Think of it like antivirus - it scans files before opening, 
but doesn't need access to your OS password.

100% safe, zero-knowledge architecture.
```

### "Which wallets are supported?"
```
All major wallets:
‚úÖ MetaMask (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.)
‚úÖ TronLink (Tron)
‚úÖ Phantom (Solana)
‚úÖ Coinbase Wallet
‚úÖ Trust Wallet
‚úÖ Ledger (via MetaMask)
‚úÖ Any wallet supporting WalletConnect

Works with 35+ blockchains.
No installation needed - cloud-based protection.
```

### "What happens if I get a false positive?"
```
False positives are rare (0.2% rate), but if it happens:

1. Transaction gets flagged as suspicious
2. You see detailed reason why
3. You can mark as "Safe" and proceed
4. System learns from your feedback

You're ALWAYS in control.
We block by default, but you can override.

Think of it as a smart co-pilot, not an autopilot.
```

### "Can I use this for my business/DAO?"
```
Absolutely! 

Tier 3 ($249) includes:
‚úÖ Unlimited wallets (perfect for DAOs)
‚úÖ White-label option (your branding)
‚úÖ API access (integrate into your app)
‚úÖ Dedicated support
‚úÖ Custom rules for your use case

Many DAOs use us to protect multi-sig treasuries.

## üîç TRANSACTION INSPECTOR

### "Is this legal? Can I really trace anyone's transactions?"
```
100% legal! Here's why:

‚úÖ All blockchain data is PUBLIC
‚úÖ We only analyze publicly available information
‚úÖ Same data that exchanges/investigators use
‚úÖ Used by law enforcement worldwide

Think of it like Google - we help you search public blockchain data.

Use cases:
- Due diligence BEFORE accepting payment
- Portfolio analysis (your own addresses)
- Compliance screening (legal requirement for some)
- Investigation (with proper legal authorization)

We provide the tools. You use them responsibly.
```

### "How accurate is the Tornado Cash demixing?"
```
Our demixing accuracy:

Standard Tornado Cash deposits: 65-75%
Complex multi-hop: 40-60%
Recent transactions: Higher accuracy
Old transactions: Lower accuracy

How we do it:
1. Timing correlation analysis
2. Amount clustering algorithms
3. Gas pattern matching
4. Network graph reconstruction

Industry-leading, but not perfect.
We show confidence scores for transparency.

Competitors mostly can't demix at all, so we're ahead.
```

### "Can I use this for legal cases?"
```
YES! Court-admissible evidence included.

What you get:
‚úÖ SHA256 hash (proves data integrity)
‚úÖ RSA-PSS signature (proves authenticity)

‚úÖ Professional PDF reports
‚úÖ Source attribution
