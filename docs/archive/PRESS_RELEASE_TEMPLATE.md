**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

### BlockSigmaKode Launches Revolutionary Blockchain Forensics Suite on AppSumo, Making Enterprise Tools Accessible to Everyone

*Four AI-powered products offering 90%+ savings compared to industry leaders Chainalysis and TRM Labs*

**Vienna, Austria** – October [DATE], 2025 – BlockSigmaKode, an innovative blockchain security and analytics platform, today announced the launch of four professional-grade products on AppSumo, marking a significant shift in accessibility for blockchain forensics tools traditionally reserved for enterprises and law enforcement.

The suite includes Web3 Wallet Guardian (AI-powered security), Crypto Transaction Inspector (forensics tool), CryptoMetrics Analytics Pro (real-time analytics), and AI ChatBot Pro (multilingual business chatbot), all offering lifetime licenses starting at $59 compared to industry standard pricing of $2,500-10,000 per year.

**Democratizing Enterprise-Grade Blockchain Tools**

"For years, professional blockchain analysis has been locked behind $100k+ price tags, accessible only to hedge funds and government agencies," said [Founder Name], CEO of BlockSigmaKode. "We're changing that. Our AppSumo launch puts institutional-grade tools in the hands of traders, small businesses, and investigators worldwide."

The company's flagship product, Wallet Guardian, employs 15 machine learning models across 7 defense layers to protect cryptocurrency wallets in real-time, achieving sub-100ms response times with 99.8% accuracy – performance metrics that match or exceed industry leaders at a fraction of the cost.

**Key Innovations**

BlockSigmaKode introduces several industry-first features:

- **Tornado Cash Demixing**: 65-75% success rate at tracing transactions through privacy mixers, a capability previously available only to law enforcement
- **42-Language Support**: Native multilingual capabilities with RTL support for Arabic and Hebrew markets
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Integration of advanced ML models including Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for transaction pattern recognition
- **Zero-Knowledge Security**: Wallet protection without requiring private keys or seed phrases

**Market Impact**

The blockchain forensics market, currently dominated by Chainalysis (valued at $8.6B), TRM Labs, and Elliptic, has seen limited innovation in pricing and accessibility. BlockSigmaKode's AppSumo launch represents the first major disruption in this space.

"Traditional providers charge $16,000-500,000 annually for similar features," notes [Founder]. "We're offering lifetime access for $59-329. This isn't just a discount – it's a complete market repositioning."

**Technical Specifications**

- **Chain Coverage**: 35+ blockchains (vs. 15-25 for competitors)
- **Response Time**: <100ms (vs. ~200ms industry standard)  
- **Entity Database**: 8,500+ labeled addresses
- **DeFi Protocols**: 500+ tracked platforms
- **Accuracy Rate**: 99.8% threat detection
- **Uptime SLA**: 99.9%

**Customer Traction**

Since soft-launch:
- $12.5M+ in cryptocurrency assets protected
- 1.2M+ addresses analyzed
- 10,000+ businesses using the platform
- 4.9/5 star average rating

## FAQ FOR MEDIA

**Q: Why AppSumo instead of traditional SaaS pricing?**
```
A: We want to reach small businesses and individual users who can't afford $100k/year tools. AppSumo's audience aligns perfectly with our mission of democratizing blockchain forensics.
```

**Q: How do you make money at these prices?**
```
A: Volume strategy. We'd rather have 10,000 customers at $100 each than 10 customers at $100,000 each. Long-term, we'll offer premium add-ons and enterprise managed services.
```

**Q: What's your competitive advantage?**
```
A: Price (97% cheaper), innovation (industry-first features), and accessibility (42 languages, easy to use). We're also open-source core, which builds trust.
```

**Q: Can you really match Chainalysis quality at 97% lower price?**
```
A: In many ways, yes. We use similar ML techniques, have comparable accuracy, and often faster response times. Where they beat us is brand recognition and government contracts – which we're not competing for. We're targeting a different market.
