"""AI Agents module exports.

The original implementation skipped importing heavy LangChain dependencies when
agents were disabled.  Our test-suite, however, relies on these modules being
importable so that targets like ``app.ai_agents.agent.agent_executor`` can be
patched.  To balance both needs we attempt to import the modules eagerly, but
gracefully fall back to lightweight defaults when optional dependencies are not
available or agents are disabled.
